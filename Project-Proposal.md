## Summary
We are making a MERN application with CRUD functionality that lists podcasts and allows users to filter by category. Users 
will also have the ability to add to the database with their favorite podcast. 

Ultimately, we would like to give users the ability to create an account and add & delete podcasts as they wish. We would
also like to embed a Spotify player so that users can play podcast episodes directly from our application.

## Models 

### Podcast Model 
  - title (String)
  - creator(s) (Array)
  - image (String)
  - URL (String)
  - length (Number)
  - categories (Array)
  - episodes (Array)
